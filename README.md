The site https://html.com/ is an easy way for beginners to learn HTML. The reason I chose this site is due to its step-by-step guide that teaches you the basics of HTML and how to build your first website.

https://html.com/css/ is a tab on the initial HTML website. This website shows you examples of how to style a website and provides background information on CSS.
